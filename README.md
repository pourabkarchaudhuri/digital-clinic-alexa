## Description
The Digital Clinic basically plays the role of a Nutritionist, a Gym Guide for Food as well as a scraper for social data on who is sick and how far is it from the user. It gathers and polls data from REST sources and enriches the data with an enhanced customer experience.

## Inspiration
This project has been inspired from workout activists and fitness freaks who set life goals and push boundaries everyday. This is a way for them to keep track how much calories they intake, watch out for epidemics and also get emergency FAQs done for first aid
